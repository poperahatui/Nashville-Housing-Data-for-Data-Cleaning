# Data Analyst Portfolio Project : SQL Data Cleaning

## 📚 **Project Overview**

This project is part of a portfolio that highlights essential skills for data analysts, focusing specifically on **data cleaning using SQL**. The project covers practical techniques for cleaning and organizing data, ensuring it is ready for analysis or reporting. Topics include managing dates, handling null values, splitting text fields, and removing unnecessary columns.

## ✨ **Key Highlights**

1. **Standardizing Date Formats**:
   - Removing time components from sales dates for consistency.

2. **Using Self Joins**:
   - Filling null values by comparing rows within the same table.

3. **Text Parsing with SQL Functions**:
   - Extracting and manipulating specific components of text fields using `CHARINDEX` and `PARSE_NAME`.

4. **Categorizing Data with CASE Statements**:
   - Transforming column values into clear categories like 'Yes' or 'No'.

5. **Simplifying Dataset Structure**:
   - Removing irrelevant columns and splitting complex fields (e.g., owner addresses into city and state).

6. **Data Validation and Organization**:
   - Sorting and grouping data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## 🔧 **Techniques and Functions Used**

- **Date Transformation**: Converting datetime fields into date-only formats.
- **Self Joins**: Linking rows in the same table to handle missing data.
- **String Functions**: Utilizing `CHARINDEX` to locate substrings and `PARSE_NAME` for structured text splitting.
- **CASE Statements**: Simplifying and categorizing column values.
- **Column Removal**: Streamlining datasets by dropping irrelevant fields.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

- Clean and organize raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Enhance data usability by resolving inconsistencies and filling gaps.
- Demonstrate proficiency in SQL for solving real-world data challenges.

## 🛠️ **Steps to Recreate**

1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Use a raw dataset containing property, sales, and owner information.

2. **Set Up SQL Environment**:
   - Import the dataset into your SQL database.

3. **Apply Cleaning Queries**:
   - Use the provided SQL scripts to clean and transform the data.

4. **Validate the Results**:
   - Ensure the cleaned data meets expected quality and structure.
